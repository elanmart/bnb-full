# About

### Description
You can read more about the contents of this repo on my blog
* The [how I used it to manage my ML experiments](elanmart.github.io/2018-02-02-staying-sane) part
* The [how I used it to schedule jobs to 40 workers on AWS](elanmart.github.io/2018-02-06-bnb-full) part
* The [how I used it to manage AWS machines configuration](elanmart.github.io/2018-02-09-how-to-aws) part

### Motivation
This is **bnb**, my personal manager for machine learning experiments
that should be distributed to a set of remote machines.

### Simplified version
The simplified, single-node version that let's you track
your machine learning experiments can be found [here](github.com/elanmart/bnb)

### Disclaimer
This repo is the old, original code that I wrote when working on `BSc`
thesis.

I stopped developing it once my `AWS` credits run out.

I'll most likely still work on the simplified version soon, though.
